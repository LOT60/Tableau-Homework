#  Before You Begin

*  This assignment will be saved to your Tableau Public account rather than GitHub.

*  If you haven't already, be sure to create a Tableau Public account here.

*  The free tier of Tableau only lets you save to their public server. This means that each time you save your file it will be uploaded to your Tableau Public profile.

*  You are able to load and continue working on the same workbook.

*  When you are finished with your assignment, you will turn in the URL to your Tableau Public workbook along with any additional files used for your analysis.

#  Task

*  Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

*  Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple 
datasets from different periods.

*  The following are some questions you may wish to tackle. Do not limit yourself to these questions; they are suggestions for a starting point. Be creative!

#  Findings


* Hot Spots

  * As you can see in the graph Citi Bank customers were in the lead in early April. Subscriber riders took a seat back.
